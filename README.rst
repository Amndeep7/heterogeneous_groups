Heterogeneous Groups
====================

An implementation of some heterogeneous grouping algorithms that work with both numerical and categorical data.

Includes both algorithms designed by Amndeep Singh Mann and algorithms based off of work done by Yueh-Min Huang and Ting-Ting Wu in "A Systematic Approach for Learner Group Composition Utilizing U-Learning Portfolio".

Use `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ to install the library and application (at the moment, you're going to need to point it at the git repo).  Then run it via ``poetry run heterogeneous_grouping``.  Use the ``--help`` option to see all the arguments and options available.  Look at the documentation for the code to see the explanations about the algorithms.

Any PRs should pass all the jank in the dev dependencies section on their strictest settings.
